#FBAnonymizer
FBAnonymizer blurs names on your facebook with one click. Makes it easy to take screenshots without sharing any private infomation.

##How To Install
I'll try to add it to the Google Chrome Store. Until then you need to install it some other way.

####Install with crx file:

- Open "chrome://chrome/extensions/" in a tab.
- Drag the FBAnonymizer.crx to this page.

If you don't do this, you will get a popup that says you need to install it from the Chrome Store.

##How To Use
Just click the icon while on a FB tab. If names are not blured, update chrome. Support for older versions is coming later along with blackbar sensoring, instead of blur.
